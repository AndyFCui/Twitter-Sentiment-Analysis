Data Set: User of Twitter and their expressed on the tweets

Description: The user on network will share different emotion on the Social platform, like Twitter, we will see a large number expressed on the tweets. Sometimes we need to make a distribution for them. We want to get a clear bar chart for different emotion from users. 

Motivation: Sentiment Analysis, also called Opinion Mining, is a useful tool within natural language processing that allow us to identify, quantify, and study subjective information. Due to the fact that quintillion of bytes of data is produced every day, this technique gives us the possibility to extract attributes of this data such as negative or positive opinion about a subject, also information about which subject is being talked about and what characteristics hold the persons or entities expressing that opinion.

Brief Description of the Steps: We use the python to design machine learning algorithms. And we can use API for twitter, then we can use “Classification” to get a distribution data analysis. For some option, people’s emotion might up to their stock, then we might use stock Twits to get the financial data as well.
